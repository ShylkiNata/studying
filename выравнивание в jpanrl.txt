My favorite method to use would be the BorderLayout method. Here are the five examples with each position the component could go in. The example is for if the component were a button. We will add it to a JPanel, p. The button will be called b.

//To align it to the left
p.add(b, BorderLayout.WEST);

//To align it to the right
p.add(b, BorderLayout.EAST);

//To align it at the top
p.add(b, BorderLayout.NORTH);

//To align it to the bottom
p.add(b, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

//To align it to the center
p.add(b, BorderLayout.CENTER);
Don't forget to import it as well by typing:

import java.awt.BorderLayout;
